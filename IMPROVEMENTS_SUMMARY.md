# Gaming AI Chatbot - API Documentation Analysis & Improvements

## üîß Issues Fixed

### 1. **RAWG API Integration (Major Fix)**
**Problem**: The chatbot was trying to access games by name directly (`/games/Total%20War:%20Rome%20II/reviews`), causing 404 errors.

**Solution**: 
- Fixed `get_game_metadata()` to use `find_game_by_name()` which searches first, then gets details
- Fixed `get_game_reviews()` to search for the game first, get the ID, then fetch reviews
- Updated function descriptions to be more specific about RAWG capabilities

**RAWG API Capabilities (from documentation analysis)**:
- **Search**: `/games?search=query` - Find games by name, genre, developer
- **Game Details**: `/games/{id}` - Requires game ID, not name
- **Reviews**: `/games/{id}/reviews` - Requires game ID
- **Genres**: `/genres` - List all available genres
- **Platforms**: `/platforms` - List all gaming platforms

### 2. **System Prompt Improvements (Major Fix)**
**Problem**: The prompt contained annoying text like "Now let's make a visualization..." that appeared in responses.

**Solution**: 
- Completely rewrote the system prompt based on actual API capabilities
- Removed the problematic visualization instruction text
- Added specific API capability guides
- Improved query matching logic
- Made responses more natural and professional

### 3. **Enhanced API Understanding**
Based on documentation analysis, improved understanding of each API's strengths:
