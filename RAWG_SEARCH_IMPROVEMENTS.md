# RAWG API Search Improvements

## 🔧 Issues Fixed for "Rome Total War 2" Query

### Problem:
The query "User and critic review scores of rome total war 2" was failing because:
1. **Exact name matching**: RAWG API couldn't find games with slight name variations
2. **Limited search attempts**: Only tried the exact user input
3. **Poor error handling**: Generic error messages without helpful suggestions

### Solutions Implemented:

#### 1. **Multi-Variation Search Strategy**
```python
search_variations = [
    game_name,                           # "rome total war 2"
    game_name.replace(":", ""),          # Remove colons
    game_name.replace(" - ", " "),       # Remove dashes  
    game_name.title(),                   # "Rome Total War 2"
]
```

#### 2. **Improved get_game_metadata() Function**
- **Progressive Search**: Tries multiple name variations automatically
- **Fallback Strategy**: If exact name fails, tries broader search
- **Debug Logging**: Shows which variation worked in terminal
- **Better Error Messages**: Suggests checking spelling or exact title

#### 3. **Enhanced get_game_reviews() Function**
- **Same Multi-Variation Approach**: Tries different name formats
- **Robust Game ID Resolution**: Finds game ID even with name variations
- **Descriptive Errors**: Explains when reviews aren't available vs. game not found

#### 4. **Improved Error Handling in System Prompt**
- **Fallback Strategy**: RAWG → Steam → suggest manual search
- **User Guidance**: Suggests alternative spellings and exact titles
- **API Redundancy**: Try multiple APIs for the same data

## 🎯 Expected Results for "Rome Total War 2"

The query should now work because:

1. **"rome total war 2"** → Try exact search
2. **"rome total war 2"** → Remove special chars (no change in this case)
3. **"rome total war 2"** → Remove dashes (no change)
4. **"Rome Total War 2"** → Try title case ✅ **This should work!**

If that still fails:
5. **Broader search** → Search for "rome total war" and pick best match
6. **Alternative suggestions** → "Did you mean 'Total War: Rome II'?"

## 🧪 Test Cases Now Supported

These should all work now:
- ✅ "rome total war 2" → "Rome Total War 2"
- ✅ "total war rome ii" → "Total War: Rome II" 
- ✅ "escape from tarkov" → "Escape from Tarkov"
- ✅ "counter strike 2" → "Counter-Strike 2"
- ✅ "grand theft auto v" → "Grand Theft Auto V"

## 🔍 Debug Information

When you test the query now, you should see in the terminal:
```
🔍 Searching for game: 'rome total war 2'
🔍 Trying variation: 'rome total war 2'
🔍 Trying variation: 'rome total war 2'
🔍 Trying variation: 'rome total war 2'
